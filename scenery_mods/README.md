Here I post my scenery mods to make XP11 scenery work in XP12. 
Note: These are not complete sceneries, the mods only work with the original version of the scenery and you install those at your own risk!
Always make a copy of the files you replace so that you can go back - I will not provide the original files here!
In the case of payware it is your decision if you want to mod it, I will give NO SUPPORT and no waranty. Don't come running to me or the author of the scenery for help! MAKE BACKUPS!!!!!

The files go into the folder of each scenery as you see them here.
