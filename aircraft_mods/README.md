Here I post my aircraft mods to make some XP11 aircraft work in XP12.
Note: These are not complete aircraft addons, the mods only work with the original version of the addon and you install those at your own risk!
Always make a copy of the files you replace so that you can go back - I will not provide the original files here!
In the case of payware it is your decision if you want to mod it, I will give NO SUPPORT and no waranty. Don't come running to me or the author of the addon for help! MAKE BACKUPS!!!!!

The files go into the folder of each addon as you see them here.
